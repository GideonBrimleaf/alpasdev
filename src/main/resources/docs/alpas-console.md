As you may have noticed already, Alpas comes with a bunch of console commandsâ€”such as `make:controller`, `make:job`,
`route:list` etc.â€”to assist you performing some tasks from the command-line. You run an Alpas command by
prepending it with `alpas`. To see a list of all the Alpas commands as well as a short description for
each, you can use `alpas help` command.

### [Custom Commands](#custom-commands)

If the core Alpas commands are not enough for you, it is easy to create your own. Alpas actually wraps
[clikt][clikt] command library in its own thin wrapper. Clikt is very powerful library that makes
writing command line interfaces simple and intuitive.

<a name="simple-commands"></a>
#### [Simple Commands](#simple-commands)

When writing a simple custom command, all you have to do is extend `dev.alpas.console.Command` class and override
the `run()` method. The `Command` constructor receives a number of optional parameters allowing you to
configure your commands the way you want it. This includes help text, summary text etc.

The easiest way to create a command is by using `make:command` Alpas command, which will generate a new
command under `console/commands` folder.

```bash

$ alpas make:command GreetCommand

```

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="2">

```kotlin

// console/commands/GreetCommand.kt
class GreetCommand : Command(name = "greet", help = "Say hello.") {
    private val name by argument()
    override fun run() {
        success("Hello, $name!")
    }
}

```

</span>

After [registering the above command](#register), you can call it like so:

```bash

$ alpas greet you

> Hello, you!

```

<a name="generator-commands"></a>
#### [Generator Commands](#generator-commands)

Generator commands are the commands that generate some files when invoked. `make:command` is actually an example
of a generator command and so is `make:controller`. While you can use a simple command like `GreetCommand`
above to write a generator command, you have to wired few things to get it right.

Instead of extending `dev.alpas.console.Command` class, you can extend `dev.alpas.console.GeneratorCommand` class
to make your life much easier while writing such generator commands. While it may not always satisfy all your
needs for writing a generator command, but most of the times it does. You can pass `--generator` or `-g`
to `make:command` command to create a generator type command for you. Then all you have to do is
override one abstract methodâ€”`populateOutputFile()`.

Let's see an example of how we can write a `make:sandwich` generator command that creates a `NameOfSandwich.kt`
file under `sandwiches` folder, creating the folder if it already doesn't exist.

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Create a command

```bash

$ alpas make:command MakeSandwich -g

```

2. Modify `console/commands/MakeSandwich.kt` file to:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="2">


```kotlin

// console/commands/MakeSandwich.kt
class MakeSandwich(srcPackage: String) :
    GeneratorCommand(srcPackage, name = "make:sandwich", help = "Make a sandwich.") {

    override fun populateOutputFile(
        filename: String,
        actualname: String,
        vararg parentDirs: String
    ): OutputFile {

        val dir = "sandwiches"
        val file = File(sourceOutputPath(dir, *parentDirs), "${filename.toPascalCase()}.kt")
        return OutputFile()
            .target(file)
            .packageName(makePackageName(dir, *parentDirs))
            .stub(
                """
                package StubPackageName
                
                class StubClazzName {
                    fun whoAreYou() {
                        println("I am a StubClazzName sandwich")
                    }
                }
                """.trimIndent()
            )
    }

    override fun onCompleted(outputFile: OutputFile) {
        withColors {
            echo(green("MakeSandwich CREATED ðŸ™Œ"))
            echo("${brightGreen(outputFile.target.name)}: ${dim(outputFile.target.path)}")
        }
    }
}

```

</span>

Notice that we have a couple of placeholders in the codeâ€”`StubPackageName` and `StubClazzName` both of which will
be replaced with proper texts automatically when we invoke this command.

3. Register this command in `ConsoleKernel` class:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="10">


```kotlin

// ConsoleKernel.kt
// ...
override fun commands(app: Application): List<Command> {
    return listOf(MakeSandwich(app.srcPackage))
}
// ...

```

</span>

4. Now we are ready to make a sandwich.

```bash

$ alpas make:sandwich club

```

This command will generate a `sandwiches/Club.kt` file. You can actually create multiple sandwiches in one go:

```bash

$ alpas make:sandwich club blt

```

</div>

<a name="register"></a>
#### [Registering Custom Commands](#register)

After you have created your own commands, you must register them with the app otherwise they won't be available
to you. You can register a command in a number of waysâ€”the easiest one is by overriding `commands()` method
in `ConsoleKernel` class and returning a list of all your commands.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="10">

```kotlin

// ConsoleKernel.kt
// ...
override fun commands(app: Application): List<Command> {
    return listOf(GreetCommand())
}
// ...

```

</span>

> /tip/ <span>Clikt comes with many other powerful features such as `parameters`, `flags`, `choice options`,
`input prompts`, `password masking` and much more. The best part of it is that the features are properly
documented with lots of real-world examples. We highly recommend [consulting its documentation][clikt]
when creating your own commands.</span>

<a name="writing-output"></a>
### [Writing Output](#writing-output)

When you need to write some output to the console, you can use `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error` methods.
Most of these methods not only respect `--quiet` flag but also use proper ANSI colors for their purpose.

```kotlin

// ...

// prints the message in red; does NOT respect --quiet flag
error("Oops! We have a problem.")

// prints the message in green; respects --quiet flag
success("Yay! This is working.")

// ...

```

If you need more control over coloring the output, you can use `withColors()` method. Alpas uses the full-featured
text styling [Mordant](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant) library for coloring. This allows you to color the
output anyway you want. Keep in mind that `withColors()` **won't** print anything if `--quiet` flag is set.
